        [Chorus: diana starshine]
        There's a hole inside my chest
        Where you left me
        Undressed
        Yeah you blessed me
        And pressed up against me
        Every time you touch my breast
        I feel dizzy
        Like my heart is full
        And won't ever rest
        You're the best for me
        And you're arresting me
        And I could do anything
        And I would do anything
        (For me)

        [Verse 1: diana starshine]
        Every time I see
        It’s a test for me
        And every time I breathе
        You’re arresting me
        Evеry line I take
        Just a big mistake
        But it’s one I wanna make
        ‘Cause I feel free

        There’s a hole inside my chest

        Undressed
        Yeah you blessed me
        And pressed up against me
        Every time you touch my breast
        I feel dizzy
        Like my heart is full
        And won’t ever rest
        Yeah
        There’s a hole inside my chest
        Where you left me
        Undressed
        Yeah you blessed me
        And pressed up against me

        You’re the best for me

        [Post-Chorus: That Kid]
        ‘Cause you’ve got
        Guys and girls
        Lined up to ride you
        From all over
        When we go fast
        I get so high
        And we’re not even smokers
        I think you got a girl
        But IDK
        ‘Cause you don’t post her
        So tonight I’m back in line
        To ride your roller coaster


        [Bridge: diana starshine]
        If you’re in the club
        Pop that pussy like a cherry
        Yeah we’re never getting married
        ‘Cause we’re young
        And feeling free
        We’re snorting dust like a fairy
        Pop that pussy like a cherry
        We’re dancing
        And we don’t ever rest
        You’re the best for me
        Pop it like a cherry
        Pop
        Pop it like a cherry
        Pop it like a cherry
        Pop
        Pop it like a cherry
        Pop it like a cherry
        Pop
        Pop it like a cherry
        Pop
        Pop it like a cherry
        Pop
        Pop it like a cherry
        Pop it like a cherry
